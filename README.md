# Programming-for-data-analysis-project

This read me is to explain a little about this data set about autism in children. The reason i picked this particular topic is a personal one, i have a 5 year old daughter with severe autism who is non verbal, we have researched in great detail since her diagnosis at 22 months old as to why or how she ended up with Autism and to how we could help her progress both now and in the future. One thing that had stood out to me was how she had very bad jaundcie as a baby which was left untreated as medical staff at the time said it would go naturally. But with researching this area research has shown that this can be one major reaosn for causing autism, of course reseach also suggests many other scenarios such as it was believed older parents would cause this but this has not been proven to be the case in any large research done to date. 

I started by compiling a list of variables i wanted to include in my dataset which are the following:

1. Age in months
2. Jaundice
3. Family members with autism
4. Gender
5. ASD traits
6. Ethnicity
7. Age of mother

The reason behind this dataset in this project is to see can i find any real results to show a correlation between any of the above variables, to see is there a true connection between jaundice and these in particular.
