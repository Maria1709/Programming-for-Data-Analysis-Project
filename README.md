# Programming-for-data-analysis-project

This read me is to explain a little about this data set about autism in children. The reason i picked this particular topic is a personal one, i have a 5 year old daughter with severe autism who is non verbal, we have researched in great detail since her diagnosis at 22 months old as to why or how she ended up with Autism and to how we could help her progress both now and in the future. One thing that had stood out to me was how she had very bad jaundcie as a baby which was left untreated as medical staff at the time said it would go naturally. But with researching this area research has shown that this can be one major reason for causing autism, of course reseach also suggests many other scenarios such as it was believed older parents would cause this but this has not been proven to be the case in any large research done to date. It is unclear to why one child gets Autism and one does not hopefully with research and technological advancements in both data analysis and medical technology this will become clearer in the near future and we can find a way to a cure or preventing it form every happening.

My interest in data in this area came early in her diagnosis as we found we were doing so many therapies and interventions but at the end of a week if we had progress or regress we couldnt pin point what had caused or helped us. So with research we decided to go with ABA therapy (applied behavoural therapy) as a larger part of our multidisciplinary approach, and really just by taking data every day on how she was doing in each particular area we were working on gave us a clear indicator at the end of a week or even 3 days if it was working or not or did we need to reconsider and take another look a how and why it was not working. questioanire

The reason behind this dataset in this project is to see can i find any real results to show a correlation between any of the above variables, to see is there a true connection between jaundice and nationality in particular.
