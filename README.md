This read me is to explain a little about this data set about autism in children. The reason i picked this particular topic is a personal one, i have a 5 year old daughter with severe autism who is non verbal, we have researched in great detail since her diagnosis at 22 months old as to why or how she ended up with Autism and to how we could help her progress both now and in the future. One thing that had stood out to me was how she had very bad jaundcie as a baby which was left untreated as medical staff at the time said it would go naturally. But with researching this area research has shown that this can be one major reason for causing autism. This researhc is to se can i find some fact beiind this in my analysis. 


The reason behind this dataset in this project is to see can i find any real results to show a correlation between variables such as age and nationality but also in the connection of Jaundice at bith to future ASD diangosis.
