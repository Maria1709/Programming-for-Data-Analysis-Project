# Programming-for-data-analysis-project

This read me is to explain a little about this data set about autism in children. The reason i picked this particular topic is a personal one, i have a 5 year old daughter with severe autism who is non verbal, we have researched in great detail since her diagnosis at 22 months old as to why or how she ended up with Autism and to how we could help her progress both now and in the future. One thing that had stood out to me was how she had very bad jaundcie as a baby which was left untreated as medical staff at the time said it would go naturally. But with researching this area research has shown that this can be one major reason for causing autism, of course reseach also suggests many other scenarios such as it was believed older parents would cause this but this has not been proven to be the case in any large research done to date. It is unclear to why one child gets Autism and one does not hopefully with research and technological advancements in both data analysis and medical technology this will become clearer in the near future and we can find a way to a cure or preventing it form every happening.

My interest in data in this area came early in her diagnosis as we found we were doing so many therapies and interventions but at the end of a week if we had progress or regress we couldnt pin point what had caused or helped us. So with research we decided to go with ABA therapy (applied behavoural therapy) as a larger part of our multidisciplinary approach, and really just by taking data every day on how she was doing in each particular area we were working on gave us a clear indicator at the end of a week or even 3 days if it was working or not or did we need to reconsider and take another look a how and why it was not working. questioanire

The reason behind this dataset in this project is to see can i find any real results to show a correlation between any of the above variables, to see is there a true connection between jaundice and these in particular. 

I started by compiling a list of variables i wanted to include in my dataset which are the following:

1. Age in months
2. Jaundice
3. Family members with autism
4. Gender
5. ASD traits
6. Ethnicity
7. Age of mother

I am using two datasets to allow further analysis into the data we may find by comaparing toddlers and adults who have been diagnosed with Autism.


To assess and diagnose autism health professionals use a checklist type questionaire to check various details about that individual. For toddlers the Qchat 10 is used and this will not just help a multidisciplinary team to diagnose the condition but also the level of serverity ranging form mild to severe autism. This is just a guide and not always a true or exact refelection of that individual but it can show where one is weak or strong in a particular area, but keep in mind depending on the day it is done and if that individual is ill or tired or nervous, scared these will all affect the outcome of this test.  
Also a great deal of training is required for the person carrying out the screeing test to allow accuracy. There is no real test to screen and adult who may or may not have autism or even to check level of severity other than using the childrens screening check list and this is by no means an effective way to diagnose or assess an adult.




### Q-CHAT-10
Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers 
This is a quick referral guide for parents to complete about their toddler (12 â€“ 36 months) with concerns about autism.  
SCORING
: For questions 1-9: if you circle an answer in columns C, D or E, score 1 point per question. For question 10: if you 
circle an answer in columns A, B or C, score 1 point. Add points together for all ten questions. If your child scores more than 3 out of 10, the health professional may consider referring your child for a multi-disciplinary assessment.

Research would tell us that autism is much higher in boys than in girls, saying in and around 5,6 times higher in boys, and this is refelected in our research also of toddlers but in our adult researhc this is not the case. Also research is now telling us that Jaundice born toddlers have a greater chance of having ASD but we can see above that this is not supported by our reasearch here.

Research shows that adults who have autism have as they get older have found techniques or therapies and interventions to help them decrease the severity of their ASD symptoms this is reflected here also in our research. But researching the same in toddlers research shows that from birth or in our case 6 months old up to 36 months old that it increases in severity as they normally present at a higer percent by the time the hit the age of 3 years while thsi is not always the case but majority it is predominantly due to late diagnosis among healthcare systems and poor education fo rfamilies in the are of ASD. Which could change the outcome of the toddler research greatly and also shows with a diagnsosis and the right interventions as an adult you could be decreasing your symptoms unlike the toddlers who are increasing in symptoms or severity.
